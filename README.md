## Introduction

This is the backend of the TaskCare platform. TaskCare is a platform, developed from a teaching project, for managing
tasks within a team. The collaboration platform enables the joint definition of tasks to be completed and the
continuous monitoring of the processing status, transparently visible to everyone. The architecture and design of the
platform enables the user to access TaskCare from any device.

## Getting Started

TaskCare is generally operated on-premise. There are a few steps to follow for installation: Firstly, the
appropriate system environment with its third-party services must be set up (See [Operation](docs/operation.md))
and secondly, the application must be correctly configured (See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)). After that,
TaskCare can then be started and operated on-premise, optionally scaled horizontally.
