    This is the WebSocket STOMP API of the TaskCare backend service. Via this
    interface it is possible to be informed in real time about changes within
    a board. It enables collaboration on the same content at the same time. The
    interface does not provide any data, it only provides information about
    events. The associated data must be obtained via the RESTful interface.
